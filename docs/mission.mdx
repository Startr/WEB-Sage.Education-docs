### A Note from Our Founders  

Before diving into our mission, we invite you to read our founders' blog posts: ["Why We're Building Sage"](https://sage.education/posts/). In these post, Izzy and Alex share their inspiration, challenges, and hopes driving Sage WebUI's vision forward. It's a heartfelt introduction to why we need better open source AI alternatives!

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

Imagine a world where local, open models that can run on any machine, united as one, outperform proprietary giants like GPT-4. Even better, imagine us all having the capability to train and reproduce state-of-the-art models like GPT-4 or GPT-5 from scratch, using high-quality, curated data.

Here's the thing, though: one of the biggest challenges in creating these foundation and fine-tune models is the substantial need for **[high-quality data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11206)**, which is both costly and time-consuming to gather and curate. This is where Sage WebUI's mission comes into play. Our mission is to contribute to this vision by building the best AI interface and crowdsourcing curated datasets from our community of users.

Our Mission
We believe AI holds transformative power for society, yet complex setup requirements restrict its benefits. To democratize AI, we're building an easy-to-install local WebUI that operates offline. This lets anyone with basic skills tap into AI's powerâ€”bringing capabilities to communities everywhere.

Our Commitment
We're creating an open-source ecosystem of AI tools to make technology both accessible and beneficial for all. AI must drive progress across every community as a lever for societal advancement. By eliminating technical barriers, we aim for global impact where AI bridges gaps and creates equitable access to technology's benefits.

Our Vision: Shaping the Future
We're engineering an accessible AI future through action. Beyond the WebUI, we're crafting a community-driven ecosystem: a thriving knowledge hub for shared model presets, prompts, and insights. Here, collective intelligence refines AI to serve usersâ€”not corporations.

Our Strategy
We confront core challenges like model tuning and dataset curation head-on. Harnessing community skills, we'll pioneer paths to enhance AI precision while openly sharing improvements. Our goal is clear: Democratize access to refined datasets, removing advancement barriers for everyone.

Join us in making AI an empowering global resource. Together, we turn bold visions into reality.
